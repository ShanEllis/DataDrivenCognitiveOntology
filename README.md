# DataDrivenCognitiveOntology

This is a text mining project that uses automatic web scraping of relevant literature given terms of interest from the Cognitive Atlas (Poldrack et al., 2011). It includes a few tools from natural language processing to analyse and visualize the resulting corpus of literature.
